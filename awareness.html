<h1> Blind Children Awareness </h1>

<p>The bright morning sunshine filters gently through the clean, white blinds, announcing the beginning of another day. You blink, slowly gazing around your room, noting the tiny  particles of dust swirling in intricate patterns in the beams of light. You then briefly glance out of your window, watching a passing cardinal that landed on a thin, gnarled branch.
The child next door, however, sees only a still, black landscape each morning. He opens his eyes and stretches, just like you, but does not see the sunlight, the swirling dust particles, and the ruby-red cardinal. He relies on sound and touch to navigate his enviroment. Unlike you, the child next door is blind. </p><br>

<p>According to the American Printing House for the Blind, there are approximately 61,739 children in educational settings within the United States who are legally blind. These children are curiouse and playful, as all children are, yet there are very few specialized toys accesible to blind children. Because of their visual impairments, blind children cannot experience movies as we do, play certain games involving sight, and may have difficulty participating in running games and sports. As a result, blind children may be bored when they are alone and have lots of free time on their hands. There is a need for more specialized toys for the blind on the market. On an even larger scale, it is our responsibility, as those with sight, to make both our virtual and physical enviroments comfortable and accesible to those without sight. If we do our very best to be considerate and take the visually impaired into account when designing new items, the world will surely be a better place.</p><br>
<p> So the next time you are waking up in the morning and enjoying the sunshine, remember the child next door.</p><br>
