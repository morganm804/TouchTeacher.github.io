<p> These are the materials we worked with to build the hardware inside the TouchTeacher. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img_7.jpg" width="600"height="400">
<p>This is the soundboard we used to link sounds to certain buttons. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img_2.jpg" width="600"height="400">
<p> This is what we built in order to test the buttons and check that they were working correctly. Notice the soundboard located on the breadboard. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img_6.png" width="600"height="400">
<p>This is a picture of our team soldering wires onto the speakers. Soldering is a process in which two or more metal items are joined together by melting and then flowing a filler metal into the jointâ€”the filler metal having a relatively low melting point. Soldering is used to form a permanent connection between electronic components. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img_5.jpg" width="600"height="400">
<p>This is a photo of the now-soldered speakers and wires. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img_3.jpg" width="600"height="400">
<p> Our whole team took turns meticulously using puff paint to create the braille letters on a square of material. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img_4.jpg" width="600"height="400">
<p> The finished braille letters.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img_8.jpg" width="600"height="400">
<p> Our project finally works after we connected it to a new battery pack and speakers. Notice the new speaker connected to the breadboard due to the ones shown before not working.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img_9.jpg" width="600"height="400">
<p> We glued craft buttons onto the electric buttons in order to make the clicking surface larger. These buttons are located right beneath the letters.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img_10.jpg" width="600"height="400">
<p> This is a picture of the wires soldered to the electronic buttons instead of being placed on the breadboard. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img_1235.jpg" width="600" height="400">
<p> Sewing the buttons in place and sewing the pillow together with tiny stitches was very time-consuming, but it was well worth the effort. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img_1477.jpg" width="600" height="400">
<p> Here we soldered more wires together to make them longer in order to reach each buttons. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img_1234.jpg" width="600" height="400">
<p>This picture is what the inside of the pillow looks with the finished soldered wires to the solderable bread board. </p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Protecting the wires and the sound board by putting it inside a box. </p>

<img src="img_1472.jpg" width="600" height="400">
<p> Stuffing the pillow.</p>
<br>

<p> This is what the finished product looks like: The Specialized Toy For Blind children. </p>
